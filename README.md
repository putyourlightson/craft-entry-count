# Entry Count Plugin for Craft CMS

The Entry Count Plugin was built specifically for the Craft Plugin Development video course by Mijingo, which has since been discontinued. The [Getting Started with Craft Plugin Development](https://craftquest.io/courses/how-to-create-craft-plugin) course on CraftQuest is a good alternative.

It allows you to count and display the number of times an entry has been viewed in  [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/). The plugin is intended for educational purposes and can be freely used for simple use-cases. For anything more complex, use the [View Count](https://www.doublesecretagency.com/plugins/view-count) plugin.
